## v.1 - Olive or Twist: the barkeep companion!

Here at Team III Productions, we know what it's like to work hard, and play harder.  Our friendly app takes one of your favorite spirits, searches our wide database of varying mixologist recipes, and returns a quick and simple recipe for making cocktails on the fly.  Got some Gin, but you're sick of Tonic?  Olive or Twist it!  Love Whiskey, but don't prefer it neat?  Olive or Twist it.  Can't decide at all?  There's an app for that.

## The Tech

Under the hood, we use an Express server that handshakes with a mySQL database- filled to bursting with booze.  Our polished user interface displays a series of sleek animations, and easy to use Bootstrap buttons for a simple, mobile-friendly experience.  The novice or practiced mixologist is welcome to include their own suggestions with a submission form that saves all concoctions, no matter how bizarre, to our ever expanding library of cocktail recipes.  We've partnered with thecocktaildb.com API for an even larger spread of potential drinks for your imbibing pleasure.
